## Getting started
Copy and rename `web.env.example` to `web.env` with necessary
secrets/configured environment variables.

`docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml build`
`docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d`
`docker-compose exec web bash`

Then run in the container
```
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py persist_new_tracks
```

Then outside run
`docker-compose exec assets bash`

Then run in the container

```
npm run watch
```

You may also want to run `flow-typed install`, then `flow` as another job to
see typechecking via static analysis.


```
Then open localhost:8082/stream
```


## Deploying to production

Ssh into ec2 instance
add HOST to `web.env`

`docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.production.yml build`
`docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d`
`docker-compose exec web bash`

Then run in the container

```
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py persist_new_tracks
```

Set up cron job for persist new tracks

```
crontab -e
```

Then add and save:
```
*/5 * * * * ./manage.py persist_new_tracks
```

## Tests

Javascript (in assets container):
```
npm run test
```

Unit/Integration:
```

```
